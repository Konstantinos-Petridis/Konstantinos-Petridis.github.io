									<h3>The Problem/Opportunity:</h3>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the problem or opportunity of this project --> This project focuses on analyzing sailor and charter data using SQL.
																												 The objective was to design a relational database and extract business insights
																											     through SQL queries. </p>
								
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 1 of the Project Implementation -->Step 1: Designed the database schema based on the project requirements.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step 1 of the Project Implementation --> Designed a relational database schema.
Entities were identified and relationships between tables were defined.
Primary keys and foreign keys were carefully selected to ensure data integrity and efficient querying  </p>
								
								<!-- Start: The rest of the steps. You can copy the code below as much times as the steps of the project -->
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 2: Created tables and defined primary and foreign keys.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt -->Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), I created the database and all required tables.
Constraints such as primary keys and foreign were implemented to enforce relationships between tables. </p>
								<!-- End: The rest of the steps. You can copy the code below as much times as the steps of the project -->
								
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 3: Inserted and validated data using SQL scripts.</h4>
									
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt -->The provided datasets were inserted into the database using SQL scripts.
Special attention was given to data types, null values, and formatting to ensure accurate data storage. </p>



									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 4: Performed data quality checks and consistency validation.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> After data insertion, validation queries were executed to verify record counts, detect missing values, and ensure referential integrity.</p>
								
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 5: Data Exploration.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> Exploratory SQL queries were written to better understand the structure and distribution of the data.</p>
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 6: Wrote SQL queries to answer business-related questions.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions defined in the project.
These queries involved joins, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries to extract meaningful insights from the data.</p>
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 7: Optimized queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregations.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> Where necessary, queries were optimized for better performance by refining joins and minimizing unnecessary calculations.</p>
								
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 8: Insight Extraction.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> The query results were analyzed and translated into business insights.
Rather than focusing only on numbers, the findings were interpreted to explain trends and behaviors within the data.</p>
															
									<h4><!-- Change here: Step 2(the rest of the steps) of the Project Implementation -->Step 9: Documentation.</h4>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the Step N of the Project Implementationt --> Finally, the project was documented by organizing SQL scripts, summarizing results and describing the analysis process.</p>
								
								
								
						
								    <h4> Key Insights: </h4>
											
												<h4><!-- Change here: First Insight -->  </h4>
											    <!-- Tip: If you don't want to create a bullet list, consider removing <ul>, </ul>, <li>, </li>.
												1) <ul> is used for creating a list.
												2) <li> is used for bullet points of a <ul> list. -->

									<h3>The Outcome:</h3>
									<p><!-- Change here: Describe the outcome of the problem/opportunity you solved/analyzed for this project --> Created a project that clearly demonstrates analytical thinking and SQL proficiency, making it suitable for inclusion in a professional GitHub portfolio.</p>
